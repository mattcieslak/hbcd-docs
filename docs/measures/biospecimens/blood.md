# Blood
**Full Name**: Blood              
**Construct**: Toxicology screen, blood        
**Description**:  Results of toxicology assays in dried blood spots collected at V1

Processing of Blood Spot Cards consists of preparing 3x 1/8” punches of dried blood spot followed by extraction using an organic solvent. Detection of PETH in the extract is accomplished with a single pass using LCMSMS (Figure 1):

## PEth Assay
PEth assays are confirmation-only testing. Test results were determined to be positive (`c_peth_b_cat`), negative (value = 0), or canceled (value = 3) according to the thresholds outlined in **Table 1** (note that continuous variables should be interpreted with caution based on the limits of quantification (LOQs)). The sample-level (`c_any_specimen_b`) was correspondingly scored as positive (value = 1), negative (value = 0), and cancelled (value = 3) (**Table 2**). Class-level groupings by analyte screening tests and analyte confirmatory tests are shown in **Table 3**.

## Quality Control & Known Issues
QC procedures involved examining assay ranges and categorical versus continuous measures. No common issues were identified from QC. No potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.
