# DSM5 PTSD/Acute Stress Short Scale
**Full Name**: Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms- National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS-PTSD) and National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder)  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: NSESSS—PTSD and NSESSS—Acute Stress Disorder  
**Construct**: PTSD/acute stress disorder symptom severity  

This measure was created to capture maternal PTSD and acute stress symptoms. The Severity of Posttraumatic/Acute Stress Symptoms is a measure that assesses the severity of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder in individuals ages 18 and older following an extremely stressful event or experience. It combines items 1-9 from the National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale ([NSESSS-PTSD](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Posttraumatic-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf) and Item 3 from the National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale ([NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Severity-of-Acute-Stress-Symptoms-Adult.pdf)) into a single assessment for the HBCD study. 

Note that scores on these scales do not differentiate between symptoms of PTSD versus Acute Stress Disorder, but rather assess for trauma-related stress symptoms. As such, researchers should review the individual items to determine which scale best meets their interest. Total raw scores for each scale are computed as follows:

- Total Raw Score Acute Stress: sum of scores from questions 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10
- Total Raw Score PTSD: sum of scores from questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9

## HBCD Modifications
In future publications, authors should note that this measure is a combination of NSESSS-PTSD and NSESSS-Acute Stress Disorder as described above. The only additional modification was that we added ‘refuse to answer’, but not ‘don’t know,’ to the response options. Scoring has always allowed skips when done on paper, and the authors are not specific for how to deal with that.

## Quality Control & Known Issues 
Response distributions were reviewed for outliers and no common issues were identified. No potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.
