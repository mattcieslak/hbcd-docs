# The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
**Full Name**: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale   
**Acronym/Brief Name**: EPDS  
**Construct**: Pregnancy/postnatal depression  

<ul>
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/Postnatal%20Depression%20Scale.pdf">EPDS</a>), a sensitive, 10-item screening tool for prenatal and postpartum depression symptoms, was selected to capture symptoms of maternal depression due to its ease of administration and widely accepted use. The EPDS scoring procedure is described <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/ppc/documents/DBP/EDPS_text_added.pdf">here</a>. The following scores on the EPDS triggered a clinical alert for study staff:
    <li> EPDS suicide ('The thought of harming myself has occurred to me'), score greater than 1</li>
    <li>EPDS depression, overall score greater than 11</li>
</ul>
