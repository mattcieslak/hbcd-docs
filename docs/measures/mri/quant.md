# Quantitative MRI
## QALAS
**Full Name**: The five QALAS volumes   
**Acronym/Brief Names**: qMRI, QALAS        
**Construct**: MRI acquisition      

The QALAS sequence generates five brain volumes using turbo-flash readouts with varying T2 and T1 weightings. These volumes are used to estimate T1, T2, and proton density (PD) maps. The process begins with a T2-preparation pulse that introduces T2 weighting in the first readout/echo train. After this, an inversion pulse is applied, imparting T1 weighting to the subsequent four echo trains. A schematic of the pulse sequence diagram is shown below with representative images from each of the five acquired volumes ([Figure 1](#figure-1-qalas-pulse-sequence-diagram-courtesy-of-fujita-et-al-2024)). This combination of magnetization preparations allows for the estimation of quantitative T1, T2, and PD maps from the five acquired volumes. The sequence takes approximately 5 and 4 minutes to acquire on Siemens and GE/Philips scanners, respectively.

### Quality Control & Known Issues
QC procedures include visual inspection of the image quality of the 3rd and 4th acquired volume (depending on the age of the baby), which should resemble the tissue contrast of a T1-weighting (MPRAGE) scan. One common QC issue noted as that different sites might have different criteria for what a motion-degraded QALAS scan looks like. No potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.

## B1 Fieldmap
**Full Name**: Transmit radiofrequency field map        
**Acronym/Brief Name**: B1+ map         
**Construct**: MRI acquisition   

The HBCD MRI protocol includes a brief acquisition (<1 minute) to measure the B1+ field. B1+ maps are used to calibrate the flip angle measurements required for accurate and reliable estimation of the T1, T2 and proton density (PD) maps from QALAS images. Ideally, the flip angle prescribed on the MRI scanner would be uniform across the entire imaging volume. However, due to variations and inhomogeneities in the B1+ field, the actual flip angle can vary spatially. The B1+ map represents this spatially varying field and is used to correct flip angle measurements. Because the transmit B1+ field is spatially smooth and changes gradually, coarse resolutions are sufficient for these scans, allowing for fast acquisition times. 

Various methods exist for measuring B1+ fields, and MRI vendors provide different implementations on their platforms. For the HBCD protocol, GE and Philips scanners use the Actual Flip Angle Imaging (AFI) method (Yarnykh 2007) while Siemens scanners use the pre-saturation turbo-flash-readout sequence. Acquisition times are approximately 30–45 seconds across all three scanner types (Siemens, GE, and Philips).

### Quality Control & Known Issues
QC procedures include visual inspection of image quality. Subject matter experts note that different sites might have different criteria for what a motion-degraded B1+ mapping scan looks like.

## T1, T2, & PD 
**Full Name**: Longitudinal relaxation time; Transverse Relaxation Time; Proton Density maps      
**Acronym/Brief Names**: T1; T2; PD        
**Construct**: Processing   

For the HBCD study, the MRI working group adopted 3D-QALAS (Kvernby et al. 2014), a time-efficient, three-dimensional method that combines interleaved Look-Locker acquisition with a T2 preparation pulse. This approach enables simultaneous estimation of T1, T2, and proton density (PD) maps from a single scan and is validated across all major MRI vendors (Fujita et al. 2019).

MRI tissue contrast primarily arises from differences in longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times. Traditional neuroimaging techniques rely on qualitative relaxation time-weighted images (e.g., T1w, T2w scans), which are influenced by various factors, including pulse sequence parameters, participant positioning, and hardware effects. While we include these traditional structural scans in the HBCD protocol, these dependencies complicate interpretation, limiting the ability to associate signal changes with biological mechanisms and making quantitative comparisons across participants, longitudinal sessions, and sites challenging.

This limitation is particularly significant in pediatric neuroimaging, where rapid brain development alters free water distribution, iron content, and myelination. As a result, conventional MRI contrast varies as a function of age, making it difficult to study pediatric populations across diverse age ranges. By directly measuring relaxation properties, quantitative imaging provide insights into these neurobiological mechanisms and overcomes many of the limitations of conventional MRI, offering improved characterization of brain tissue microstructure (Deoni 2010; Does 2018).

### Quality Control & Known Issues
QC was performed via visual inspection of the parametric maps, region of interest analysis, and comparison of quantitative parametric values.

Subject matter experts note that currently, the SyMRI toolbox does not incorporate externally acquired B1+ field maps into the quantitative T1, T2, and PD estimation. In addition, there are variations of the estimated quantitative T1 values across the three MRI vendors and across age. Current estimates do not align well with prior literature and may result from certain assumptions in the modeling procedures. This is currently a work in progress to correct. As a result, the quantitative T1 (and consequently the PD) values will not be initially released.

## Sy-T1w, Sy-T2w
**Full Name**: Synthetically generated T1- and T2-weighted volumes      
**Acronym/Brief Names**: Sy-T1w, Sy-T2w     
**Construct**: Processing

The 3D-QALAS technique in conjunction with the Synthetic MRI (SyMRI) toolbox provides synthetically generated T1-weighted and T2-weighted volumes. Synthetic images are generated by substituting quantitative estimates of T1 and T2 relaxation times back into the governing MR signal equation (or the Bloch equations) for each sequence. This provides the flexibility to produce images of various contrasts without needing to acquire these data at a given set of imaging parameters.
