## Food Insecurity
**Full Name**: 2-item Food Insecurity   
**Acronym/Brief Name**: USDA short form  
**Construct**: Food Insecurity   

Food Insecurity, based on two items assessing the availability of food, is a screening measure used across many populations indicating risk of food insecurity in the last 12 months. Each question uses the same response options. This measure was modified slightly for HBCD to use gender-neutral terms (children aare referred to as “the child” in place of gendered pronouns) as well as inclusion of "Don't know" as a response option to survey questions. Researchers should be aware that the validated measure uses Yes/No answers and does not account for missing data.
