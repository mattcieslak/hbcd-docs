# Infant Sensor Questionnaire
**Full Name**: Daily survey about infant heart rate sensor and infant leg movement sensors   
**Acronym/Brief Name**: Infant Sensor Questionnaire  
**Construct**: motor behavior, physical activity, sleep   

The Infant Sensor Questionnaire, developed by the HBCD Workgroup, was sent daily over 3 days while the infant wore heart rate and leg movement sensors to capture context for the recordings. Sent automatically to primary caregivers at 24, 48, and 72 hours, the survey covered the preceding 24 hours, asking if sensors were worn consistently and gathering information on daily activities (e.g., typicality of the day; nap and sleep duration; time spent in car seat, swing, or other restraining device; time in a moving car or stroller; and leg swaddling during sleep). See [Pini et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101446) for a full description of this measure.

## Quality Control & Known Issues 
A small percentage of surveys (due to the procedure being manual) were randomly spot-checked on a weekly basis to confirm presence of responses. When no responses were received, RAs were contacted to confirm whether the surveys had been sent to participants as intended. The most common cause of missing responses was caregiver non-response, and less commonly due to human error (preferred contact/contact method not selected by RA) or technological malfunction. No issues were flagged for this measure by subject matter experts.
